Welcome to the Nuthatch documentation!
===================================

A lightweight framework for computer algebra using `FLINT` and `Python-FLINT`
at its core.



# What it is.

- `Nuthatch` is designed to provide a minimal layer of abstraction, giving a
`SAGE`-like feel to `Python-FLINT`. The goal is for parity to `Python-FLINT` in
terms of speed.
- Its audience is mathematicians and computer scientists who need to use
algebraic objects (commutative rings, polynomials, chain complexes, and categories) to
easily build new algebraic objects.
- A `Python` package, which plays well with the ecosystem of packages.
Eventually, this will include wheel builds and `pip install` capabilities.
- Built for parallelizability?
- Mathematical.
- Fundamental principle: no automatic coercions.

how to :ref:`installation` the project.
