# Nuthatch.

A lightweight framework for computer algebra using `FLINT` and `Python-FLINT`
at its core.



# What it is.

- `Nuthatch` is designed to provide a minimal layer of abstraction, giving a
`SAGE`-like feel to `Python-FLINT`.
- Its audience is mathematicians and computer scientists who need to use
algebraic objects (commutative rings, polynomials, chain complexes, and categories) to
easily build new algebraic objects.
- A `Python` package, which plays well with the ecosystem of packages.
Eventually, this will include wheel builds and `pip install` capabilities.
- Built for parallelizability?



# What it is not.

- `Nuthatch` is not meant to be a replacement for `SAGE` or for `SymPy`. It has
a tiny fraction of the capabilities of `SAGE`, a tiny fraction of the lifetime
of tests that `SAGE` has passed, and none of the printing and display options.
